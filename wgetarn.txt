# Ver 1:	I wrote this script in answer to a couple of
#		people wanting the wget command to access the
#		*news.mp3 files on both AR Newsline (news.mp3)
#		and/or ARRL Audio News (arrlnews.mp3).
#		You can run this program in two ways...
#
#		wgetarn (no flags) this will run the program
#		manually and ask you what News file to get.
#
#		-OR-
#
#		wgetarn flag (ARN or ARRL) this will allow you
#		to run the program as a IRLP CRON job, or via
#		DTMF from the $CUSTOM/custom_decode file.
# 
# 
#		Here are the two entries for the custom_decode
#		file. Change the XXX to be your DTMF entries.
#		If you wish to run it as a cron job you will
#		need to read up on IRLP cron.
#
#	if [ "$1" = "XXX" ] ; then "$CUSTOM"/wgetarn ARN ; exit 1 ; fi
#	if [ "$1" = "XXX" ] ; then "$CUSTOM"/wgetarn ARRL ; exit 1 ; fi
# 
# 
#
